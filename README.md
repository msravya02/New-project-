Project Overview
This project is a YouTube Clone, which replicates the core functionalities of YouTube. The application allows users to search for videos, play videos, like/dislike content, and view video details like the number of views, likes, and comments. It is built using a modern web development stack, providing a seamless video streaming experience similar to YouTube.
